<objective>
Close verification gaps for Phase 6 Direct Delivery by adding tests for delivery callbacks, MessageState transitions, and field preservation over live Links.

Purpose: The verification found that while basic Kotlin<->Python delivery now works (fixed in 4a5b292), the tests don't verify:
1. Delivery callbacks fire correctly
2. MessageState transitions through OUTBOUND -> SENT -> DELIVERED
3. Custom fields and attachments survive live Link delivery (only pack/unpack format was tested)

Output: Extended LiveDeliveryTest.kt with comprehensive callback, state, and field preservation tests
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Add delivery callback and MessageState tests</name>
  <files>lxmf-core/src/test/kotlin/network/reticulum/lxmf/interop/LiveDeliveryTest.kt</files>
  <action>
Add new tests to LiveDeliveryTest that verify:

1. **Kotlin -> Python with delivery callback** (test method: `delivery callback fires on successful K to P delivery`):
   - Register `message.deliveryCallback` before sending
   - Send via `kotlinRouter.handleOutbound()`
   - Verify callback fires when Python confirms receipt
   - Verify message.state == MessageState.DELIVERED or SENT

2. **MessageState lifecycle tracking** (test method: `MessageState transitions correctly during delivery lifecycle`):
   - Create message, capture initial state
   - Call handleOutbound, capture state after outbound
   - Wait for delivery, capture final state
   - Assert state sequence: initial state -> OUTBOUND/GENERATING -> SENT/DELIVERED
   - Pattern: capture `message.state` after each operation and assert transitions match expected lifecycle

3. **Failed delivery callback test** (optional if time permits):
   - Send to non-existent destination
   - Verify state transitions to FAILED
   - Verify failedCallback fires

Use existing test patterns from LiveDeliveryTest. Reference LXMessage.kt for state/callback fields and LXMRouter.kt for how callbacks are invoked.

Run: JAVA_HOME=~/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew :lxmf-core:test --tests "LiveDeliveryTest" --rerun-tasks 2>&1
All tests pass including new callback and state tests.
  </verify>
  <done>
- Test method `delivery callback fires on successful K to P delivery` exists and verifies callback fires
- Test method `MessageState transitions correctly during delivery lifecycle` exists and asserts state sequence from GENERATING through SENT or DELIVERED
- All LiveDeliveryTest tests pass
  </done>

  <name>Task 2: Add live field preservation tests</name>
  <files>lxmf-core/src/test/kotlin/network/reticulum/lxmf/interop/LiveDeliveryTest.kt</files>
  <note>This task builds on Task 1 and modifies the same file. Task 1 must complete first.</note>
  <action>
Add test that verifies custom fields survive live Link delivery (test method: `custom fields preserved over live Link delivery`):

1. **Custom fields over live Link**:
   - Create message with custom fields (e.g., FIELD_RENDERER = "renderer", FIELD_THREAD_ID = "thread123")
   - Send via live TCP connection to Python
   - Use bridge command `lxmf_get_messages_with_fields` to retrieve messages with fields_hex

2. **Extend getPythonMessages() if needed**:
   - Add new helper method `getPythonMessagesWithFields()` that calls bridge command returning `fields_hex`
   - Parse fields_hex in test to verify FIELD_RENDERER and FIELD_THREAD_ID values match

3. **Alternative if bridge extension is impractical**:
   - Document in test comment that Phase 3 CustomFieldInteropTest validates field pack/unpack compatibility
   - Live delivery uses same serialization, so field preservation is validated transitively
   - Still create the test but assert on content/title (fields validated by Phase 3)

Reference Phase 3 tests (CustomFieldInteropTest) for field handling patterns.
Reference bridge_server.py for how to get field data from Python LXMF.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: JAVA_HOME=~/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew :lxmf-core:test --tests "LiveDeliveryTest" --rerun-tasks 2>&1
All tests pass including field preservation test.
  </verify>
  <done>
- Test method `custom fields preserved over live Link delivery` exists
- Test either: (a) verifies fields via extended bridge returning fields_hex, OR (b) documents that Phase 3 validates field serialization and live delivery uses same path
- All LiveDeliveryTest tests pass
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completing all tasks, run the full test suite:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=~/android-studio/jbr ./gradlew :lxmf-core:test --tests "*LiveDeliveryTest*" --rerun-tasks 2>&1
```

Expected: All tests pass, including new callback/state/field tests.

Also verify Phase 6 truths are now covered:
1. "Kotlin client can send LXMessage to Python client over Link" - existing tests
2. "Python client can send LXMessage to Kotlin client over Link" - existing tests
3. "Message content and fields preserved end-to-end" - new field tests
4. "Delivery receipts/confirmations work bidirectionally" - new callback tests
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. LiveDeliveryTest includes test that verifies delivery callback fires
2. LiveDeliveryTest includes test that tracks MessageState transitions
3. LiveDeliveryTest includes test for field preservation over live Link (or documents validation approach)
4. All existing and new tests pass
5. Gap closure documented in commit message
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-direct-delivery/06-03-SUMMARY.md`
